# Powershell script to switch between audio outputs. Currently running in Windows 11 pro

## Description
Powershell script to change audio output based on name of the outut device and the cmdlet "AudioDeviceCmdlets"
The script can then be called via autohotkey or similar programs. I mainly use it to switch between audiodevices with one key on a macropad. 

## Flow
### Macropad
<b>Macropad</b> -> via macropad software, creating key combination shift+ctrl+j -> 

### Autohotkey
<b>autohotkey</b> when recieving shift+ctrl+j runs 

### Powershell
<b>powershell</b> script -> <b>switchaudio.ps1</b>
